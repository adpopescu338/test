# Back-end
Using python with flask for APIs, 
# Front-end
For front-end I'm using react. The todo list is fetched inside a Context, which wrapps the app and makes the data available through the function useData()
While the data is being fetched, the page will show a spinner
# Unit test
A very basic test is included, which checks that the loading state is rendered correctly
